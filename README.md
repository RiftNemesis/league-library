# League Library

This project is based on a game called League of Legends, made by Riot Games. The goal of this project was to get experience working with React, APIs and PWAs.
In this project you can freely browse all the champions from the game using Riot Games' APIs.

Main features:
- Fully supported for mobile devices with custom layouts and behavior.
- Full browser support(Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge).
- A welcoming page that explains the purpose and topic of the app.
- Main page where all the champions from the game(their names and their splash arts) are collected.
- A search bar that enables searching for champions, in real-time.
- Clicking on a champion card will bring up a panel with more detailed information about said champion, including lore, abilities and a collection of cosmetic skins.
- A slideshow of images of all the champions' cosmetic skins.
